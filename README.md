This project showcases an interactive sales report built using Power BI. The dataset used for this report is sourced from Kaggle and is based on a Superstore's sales data. You can find the dataset here: [Superstore Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/superstore-dataset).

- **Order ID**

## Power BI Report Features

In this Power BI report, I developed several pages and features:

- **Overview Page**: Provides a high-level summary of the key metrics.
- **Sales Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of sales performance.
- **Sales by City**: Visualization of sales distribution across different cities.
- **Profit Analysis**: Insights into profit margins and drivers.
- **Quantity Analysis**: Tracks the quantity of products sold.
  
### Navigation and User Experience

To enhance the user experience, I implemented Power BI bookmarks and navigation features to create a streamlined homepage interface, allowing users to easily switch between different report pages.
